This notebook contains neural network regression on Boston housing dataset provided by tensorflow
Key highlights:
1. Loading data from boston housing (with the split of test and train)
2. Looking at the train and test datasets, with  their shapes
3. Without normalization
4. With normalization was not possible since they did not provice column names
5. Could normalize in future though
